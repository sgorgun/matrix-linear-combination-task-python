# Matrices. Computing the linear combination task

Programming assignment that checks your abilities to compute linear combination of vectors.

You task is to implement a function with the following signature:

`linear_combination(matrix: List[List[float]], weights: List[float]) -> List[float]`

that returns a linear combination of columns of a given `matrix` using a given list of `weights` that correspond to the columns.
