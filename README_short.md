# Matrices. Linear combination

## Purpose

The coding exercise is designed to test knowledge of the following concepts:

* Linear combination of vectors

## Overview

The coding exercise covers the following practical problem:
* Computing a linear combination of columns for a given matrix

## Evaluation

The following rules are applicable to all coding exercises:
* Each correctly solved coding exercise costs 100 points
* It is recommended to sequentially approach coding exercises as difficulty may gradually increase from the first exercise to the last one. Sometimes coding exercises are easier to accomplish having the preceding ones done.
* For each coding exercise there are two test suits:
  * `sample tests`
    * visible to students and put into `tests` folder
    * help students to troubleshoot their solutions locally before submitting
    * students could add their own tests if needed
  * `hidden tests`
    * not visible to students and will be run to evaluate submitted solutions in Autocode platform
    * designed to test both correctness and efficiency of submitted solutions
* Coding exercises are evaluated independently
  * Only a subset of solutions for coding exercises could be submitted
* For each coding exercise there are only two options:
    * 0 points - a submitted solution did pass the `hidden tests`
    * 100 points - a submitted solution did not pass the `hidden tests`
* The following formula is applied to score each submission
  * `score` = 100 * `number of coding exercises for which hidden tests passed`
