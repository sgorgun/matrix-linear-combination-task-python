# Matrices. Computing the linear combination task

A set of programming assignments that checks your abilities to compute linear combination of vectors. 
The source vectors are passed by the columns of the initial matrix. 
The weights that are used for computing the linear combination are passed 
by the array `weights`. The initial `matrix` of numbers has dimensions $`m\times n`$ and
has to be passed as a list of lists of numbers. The target function has signature 
`linear_combination(matrix: List[List[float]], weights: List[float]) -> List[float]` and produces a list of numbers.
